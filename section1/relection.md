## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

...I thought this list was really comprehensive and broke down what it means to be a good learner into it's basic components. I already feel that I read a lot and have the mindset of viewing learning as a journey not a destination. I definitely feel that I need to incorporate the teaching others point into my learning routine/process more -- that is a very solid way to really emphasize and retain information. I also need to more actively practice taking regular breaks as I do tend to get very focused and perhaps don't step away from a problem as often as I should.

...I think something I'd add that I value in myself as a learner would be curiosity. This goes hand in hand with viewing learning as a process and adopting a growth mindset, but encouraging & indulging that natural curiosity we all have gives the learning process its spark and makes the process all the more enjoyable even through the challenging bits.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

...The three data types I learned about in this section are:
..* String: A data type that consists of letter or other characters inside quotes. Strings can work with all kinds of text (even numbers and special characters).
..* Number: A data type that handles all numbers including negatives and decimals. Math can be performed on this data type.
..* Boolean: A data type that evaluates to either true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```JavaScript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

...You use two back slashes in order to comment out text in Javascript files. The purpose of code comments is to provide additional context and information for developers in written language.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

...A variable is a piece of stored information or data that we can use in multiple places. It allows us to convey information in a concise way by assigning it a name for future use. For example, we could convey someone's favorite food by using the `var favoriteFood = "Spaghetti"`.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

...One app that I use a lot is Instacart to order groceries. I would imagine several variables that are likely used are name (string data type), phone number (number data type), and payment method (number data type).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

...Concatenation is used to join together strings and defined variables using the + operator. Javascript will convert number data types into an end-result string when used with concatenation (called type coercion).

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

...On my Wells Fargo banking app, when I login the screen will read "Good evening/morning, Madison," and then list the date and time. That data could be presented via concatenation by combining the welcome message based on the time of day and my name.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

..*Regarding concatenation vs interpolation, I'm not certain if I'm grasping what the benefit of concatenation would be or why it would be used over interpolation. It seems as if interpolation is quicker, and overall easier to read.

..*Are there other data types that Javascript consists of aside from the three introduced in this section?
