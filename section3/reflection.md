## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* I really connected with the idea that people are not fixed with certain abilities or talents. Rather we can learn and grow in anything with hard work and dedication to learning (among other things). In my life I've often heard that some people are just more talented at one particular task/subject over another and not everyone has the "mind" for certain subjects. It's incredibly encouraging and refreshing to read about Growth Mindset wherein any task or subject is within reach with enough passion and dedication.
* I also felt the explanation of improving within one's Zone of Proximal Development was interesting. This seems very logical and self-explanatory to me that whilst learning you wouldn't be given a task or challenge outside your realm of ability, but I hadn't really seen it laid out like it was in the article before. Going into Turing with that mindset that challenges or projects I face aren't going to be unknowns to me, but rather pushing me a bit beyond what I've already learned will be important to remember and help keep me on track and help large tasks & projects not seem as overwhelming.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think I'm very open to making mistakes and criticism -- I really value feedback and debriefing after projects or tasks. That way I can take in what went well as well as what can be worked on or improved for the future. I feel that's a vital aspect of my learning process, that debrief period. As far as areas where I don't fully demonstrate a Growth Mindset or could improve upon would be asking questions or asking for help. I learn really well when I can tackle topics independently first, make my own mistakes and figure out what went wrong. However while that isn't inherently a bad thing, I can absolutely see it running away from me and spending too long on a problem. It's important to me to be aware of that tendency within myself and work to find that line where independent work is no longer efficient or helpful. At those points I want to work on asking for help from my cohort or engaging other resources.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I use Twitch pretty regularly and I would imagine that arrays would be utilized to store the lists of followed channels for any given user. This is a list of information that is displayed whenever a user logs in. And there is further filtering going on within those arrays in the form of letting a user know which channels are online/streaming when they log on and which channels are offline.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Methods are functions that can be used on certain data types -- Array Methods are functions that can be used on arrays so that you can get additional information out of those data types or display that information in different ways. For example, one Array Method is the Sort Method that would sort the elements within an array in ascending order and returns the sorted array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Loops allow for programs to utilize automation to arrive at answers or perform tasks. Loops allow for quicker and more efficient programs. If you have a collection of data in an array that you need to perform iteration on (for example, parsing out ages and displaying different messages depending on age) then you would use a loop with that data in the array. But if you don't have a collection of data or array and you need the program to repeat a task (for example, returning a list of numbers 1-100 with only the even numbers displayed), then you could just use a loop without an array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Loops are checking a statement for whether it's true or false. If the statement is true then the program will perform a task (like display "Hello!") -- then it will continue to loop through and display "hello!" as long as that condition is true. Once it's false it'll stop.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

* I understand that there are subtle differences between the three main types of loops, but I would like to get additional clarity on best practices on using one over another, particularly between WHILE and DO...WHILE loops.
* Are there array methods that do the same thing as a loop? Looking through some array methods it looks like the Map method might have looping baked in?
