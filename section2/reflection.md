## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I sometimes tend to feel some anxiety around asking questions -- I tend toward the waiting too long end of the spectrum, partly because I feel I learn best when I'm able to work out a problem for myself, but I also recognize that this is absolutely not always the most efficient use of my time. As I move forward with Mod 0 and into Mod 1 and beyond I'm committed to working on finding that balance between working through problems independently and utilizing my resources to ask for help.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I thought having some of those supports removed really helped to reinforce the material more in my mind. For example, removing the directions for running a file in node forced me to memorize that and now it won't be something I'll forget. Additionally, exploring the outside resources on functions (the Medium blog post and Codcademy resources) helped reinforce that concept. Ultimately it can feel a bit uncomfortable at first, particularly because these are pretty new concepts to me, but utilizing outside resources on my own and then arriving at answers using that info can help instill confidence!

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A statement based on the idea of if/then/else. These statements rely on a check of a particular condition in order to decide what to do next.
* A daily life example: If the weather forecast calls for rain today I won't go to the park, otherwise I will go to the park.
* An example from my Wells Fargo app: If the username and password are correct for user then return login successful screen, else return login unsuccessful screen.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

First, you would need to define the first condition of the `if` statement along with what should execute if the condition evaluates to true. To add an additional condition, you would use the statement `else if` and define the second condition along with what code should execute if that second condition evaluates to true. Essentially, the program is reading the first condition and if that evaluates to true it stops reading the rest. If it evaluates to false then it continues on to the second condition and so on so forth. At the end of the statement, `else` can be used with a final message to execute if none of the above conditions of the statement are met.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Developers can use logical operators to have a program check on whether two conditions are met or if 1 of the 2 condition are met. There are two logical operators, the AND operator `&&` and the OR operator `||`. The AND operator checks on whether two conditions are true before running a block of code while the OR operator will check on whether at least 1 of 2 conditions are met before running code.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

* I would like to get some more clarity on the `&&` and `||` operators when used with non-Boolean data types. It seems like they work, but I'm not certain what the point of utilizing those operators for non-Boolean data types would be.

* I'm still a bit unclear on when it's best to write function arguments as values vs writing the arguments as variables.
