## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
I downloaded a Chrome extension called Marinara that essentially acts as a Pomodoro timer. It was actually pretty helpful! I didn't use it during every single work session, but if I had an extended block of time booked out for study/work that was longer than an hour I used it. I found myself getting a bit frustrated every now and then if I was in a groove and it wanted me to take a break, but ultimately I do think those breaks were for my own good and benefited me more than anything else.


1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I liked this exercise with setting an intention. I'm pretty good about setting a goal for a chunk of time I have blocked out, but it's been good to define it even more. I would type out the intention on a sticky note on my desktop and then once it was complete I'd check it off. Checking those off was gratifying and it was helpful to have clearly defined goals. I do think I was much more focused with those bite-size goals to follow.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is similar to an array in that it is a way to store complex data. However, unlike an array, the data of an object can be accessed vis index positions & strings. In this way, an object can be treated more like a database.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - Array would work here since it's just a list of names in one data point.
  * List of states and their capitals - An object would be best here with a key for the state and a key for the capital.
  * List of things to pack for vacation - An array would also work here if it's just a simple list of items to pack.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - You could use an array for this data since it's a list with one data point.
  * List of student names and their cohort - An object would be better for this since there are multiple data points needed here including each student and their cohort.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - An Object would be better here since there is more complex information needed; the ingredients and amount of each.
  * All my favorite restaurants - Array since this is a simple list with a single data point (favorite restaurant name).

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
In my Instacart app an Object could be used to hold the data on a specific shopping trip -- it would need to hold the data of the shopping list itself as well as the quantities for each item. It would then need to hold my user information (name, address, payment info) as well as any coupons I might use before checking out. Some example keys might be:
  * Username
  * Payment info
  * delivery address
  * Shopping cart

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
* I found Objects and particularly Classes a bit more challenging to wrap my head around! Specifically class methods -- class methods are actually functions, correct? I'm not clear on the difference between methods and functions as they seem to do really similar things.
* I'm super interested to learn more about how classes and objects can be automated, especially knowing that Classes are "object factories." When doing the Tweet exercise I could see how a user action might trigger the addLikes method to trigger or trigger a new object instance -- however I have no idea how that would actually work in practice. How do we give an end-user that functionality? Can't wait to learn more!
